# Introduction

This is SageMath package dedicated to growth functions of periodic tessellations.
The package finds growth functions and visualize how crystallographic growth functions depend on frame's anchor point.
All results are exact. Numerical errors are eliminated by using symbolic computations.

Definition of growth functions and basic information about the package you can find on the poster (doc/poster.pdf)


# Implemented features
1. Finding topological growth functions
2. Finding crystallographic growth functions
    * For frames defined by translation vectors
    * For frames with scaled sides
3. Finding and visualizing regions within which growth functions are identical


# Installation
Go to main directory of the repository and type in terminal following commands

```console
python3 -m build
sage --pip install ./dist/crystgrowthpoly-0.0.1.tar.gz
```
